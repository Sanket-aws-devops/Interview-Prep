Interview questions on s3 
===========================

storage classes in s3 
  -Standard: Default, general-purpose storage for frequently accessed data.
  -Intelligent-Tiering: Automatically moves data between two access tiers (frequent and infrequent) based on access patterns.
  -One Zone-IA: For infrequently accessed data that doesnâ€™t require multiple Availability Zones for resilience.
  -Glacier: Low-cost storage for data that is archived and rarely accessed.
  -Glacier Deep Archive: Very low-cost storage for long-term archival data that is rarely accessed.


How does S3 encryption work?
  -S3 supports multiple encryption options to protect data at rest:
  -SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption with S3-Managed Keys): Automatically encrypts data using S3-managed keys.
  -SSE-KMS (Server-Side Encryption with AWS Key Management Service): Uses a customer-managed key in KMS.
  -SSE-C (Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys): The customer provides the encryption key.
  -Client-Side Encryption: Data is encrypted before being uploaded to S3.  


What are S3 Access Control Lists (ACLs), and how do they work?
  -S3 ACLs are a way to grant specific permissions (read, write, list, etc.) to individual AWS accounts or groups (e.g., AuthenticatedUsers, Everyone).
  -Example: You can use an ACL to allow public read access to an object or restrict access to specific users.  


Scenario: You need to store sensitive data in S3, and you are required to ensure that no unauthorized access occurs. What would you do to secure the data?
  -Answer: To secure sensitive data in S3:
  -Enable encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) for data at rest.
  -Use IAM policies to enforce fine-grained access control. Ensure that only authorized users or roles have access to the data.
  -Implement S3 Bucket Policies to restrict access to specific IP addresses or VPCs.
  -Enable S3 Access Logging to track access to the bucket and objects.
  -Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor API requests for security auditing.
  -Set up MFA Delete to require multi-factor authentication for deleting objects.  


What is Event Notification in S3, and how can you use it in a real-world scenario?
  -Answer: S3 Event Notification allows you to trigger actions in response to certain events in your S3 bucket (like object creation, deletion, etc.).
  -Example: You can trigger an AWS Lambda function when an object is uploaded to an S3 bucket, which could automatically process the file (e.g., image resizing, video encoding) or send an email via Amazon SNS to notify users.
  -You can also configure event notifications to trigger actions like sending the object to an SQS queue for further processing


Scenario: You need to archive old logs in S3 but want to ensure they are automatically deleted after 3 years. How would you implement this?
  Answer:
  -You can use S3 Lifecycle Policies to automatically transition objects to S3 Glacier after a certain period (e.g., 30 days) and then delete the objects after 3 years.
  -Set the lifecycle policy as follows:
  -Transition objects to Glacier after 30 days.
  -Delete the objects after 3 years.
  -This helps with cost optimization while ensuring compliance with data retention policies.
