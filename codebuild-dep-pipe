Scenario-Based Questions
Scenario: You have a microservices architecture deployed on ECS using AWS CodePipeline. A new feature requires changes in multiple services simultaneously. How would you manage this deployment?
Discuss your approach to coordinating deployments across services.
Scenario: Your team has identified a performance bottleneck during the build phase of your pipeline using AWS CodeBuild. What steps would you take to optimize the build process?
Consider aspects like instance types, caching, and parallel builds.
Scenario: A recent deployment via AWS CodeDeploy caused downtime due to a bug in the application code. How would you implement safeguards to prevent this in future deployments?
Discuss strategies like canary releases or automated rollbacks.
Scenario: You need to deploy an application that requires database migrations as part of the deployment process using AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy. How would you handle this requirement?
Explain your approach to managing database changes safely.
Scenario: Your organization is transitioning from a monolithic application to microservices hosted on AWS Lambda, managed by CodePipeline. What considerations should be taken into account during this transition?
Discuss architectural changes, testing strategies, and deployment methodologies.
